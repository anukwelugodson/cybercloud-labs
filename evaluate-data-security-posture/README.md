## Project summary (simple)
This is my IBM SkillsBuild capstone project. I acted as a cybersecurity specialist and evaluated Cedarville Family Health (a small clinic). I checked how they store and protect patient data (PHI), found risks, and recommended practical fixes. I completed the SkillsBuild form, then wrote these documents to show what I did and why.

## What I did — step by step (so anyone can follow)
1. Opened the IBM SkillsBuild capstone page for **"Evaluate an Organization’s Data Security Posture"**.  
2. Read the scenario carefully (office manager email + two clinic policies + HIPAA Security Rule summary).  
3. Completed the SkillsBuild form sections in order:  
   - Compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule (checkboxes & short answers)  
   - Governance & oversight and Risk management (checkboxes & short answers)  
   - Risk assessment (identify risks, consequences, recommendations)  
   - Data backup plan (Task 1)  
   - Encryption strategy (Task 2)  
4. As I answered the form, I saved screenshots (I will add them later in `/evidence/`).  
5. I wrote these documents to record exactly how I analyzed the clinic and why I chose each answer and recommendation.

## What is in this repository
- `risk-assessment.md` — full risk list, my reasoning, IBM Q&A for the risk section.  
- `backup-plan.md` — practical backup plan I created for the clinic + IBM Q&A for Task 1.  
- `encryption-recommendations.md` — encryption choices and steps + IBM Q&A for Task 2.  
- `evidence/` — (put your SkillsBuild screenshots and badge here after you capture them).

## How I documented (short instructions)
- I wrote each file in clear English so non-technical people can read it.  
- I used simple tables and bullet lists for clarity.  
- When I finished, I committed the files to GitHub so recruiters can read my workflow and decisions.

## Evidence (placeholders)
After you finish the SkillsBuild form, save screenshots in `evidence/`:
- `evidence/skillbuild-capstone-step1.png`  
- `evidence/skillbuild-capstone-submit.png`  
- `evidence/ibm-badge.png`

Add those files and commit. I will help you format them if you want.
